# to revamp RHCSA and RHCE notes

## The goal:
- transfer notes from OneNote to Github in a persistent and readable manner
- merge RHCSA and RHCE into one single notes by combining similar content
- 查漏补缺
- Serve as a master referencing notes when preparing for RH300 course to get myself certified. 

## Not:
- Do not expect this activity will improve my technical knowledge greatly as majority of the notes I already have some experiences in day to day working.
